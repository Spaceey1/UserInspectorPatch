[DEPRICATED] UserInspector Fix
===========

This mod is now depricated as the bug this aimed to fix is now officially fixed.

This is a [MonkeyLoader](https://github.com/ResoniteModdingGroup/MonkeyLoader.GamePacks.ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that fixes the bugged user inspector by forcing the user inspector to always generate the user list, regardless if you're the host or not.

===========

This mod can be installed by following these steps:

1. Download and install MonkeyLoader from the [MonkeyLoader GitHub repository](https://github.com/ResoniteModdingGroup/MonkeyLoader.GamePacks.ResoniteModLoader/releases).
2. Download latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Spaceey1/UserInspectorPatch/releases) page
3. Locate your Resonite installation directory.
4. Open the `MonkeyLoader/Mods` folder within the Resonite installation directory. (This is a different path than for RML mods!)
5. Copy the downloaded mod file (`UserInspectorPatch.*.nupkg`) into the `Mods` folder.
